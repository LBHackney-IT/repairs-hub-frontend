# Hackney Repairs Hub frontend

Allows agents and managers to raise, review, approve and close work orders.

Allows operatives to sign in to a "mobile working" view, see upcoming jobs and complete them.

## Dependencies

It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app that works with:

- [Service API for Repairs](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/repairs-api-dotnet)
- Hackney's [Google oAuth service](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/LBH-Google-auth)

It's built using [Hackney Design System](https://design-system.hackney.gov.uk/).

## Development Setup

### Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:LBHackney-IT/repairs-hub-frontend.git
```

The app needs Node 14, if you have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed just run `nvm use` in your terminal.

Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Local Environment Variables

The project contains quite a few environment variables. If you are using VSCode, you may like to use the [dotENV extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv) for working with .env files.

Create the following files to store local secrets (which are gitignored):

- `.env`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.test.local`

Values for these are to be found in Hackney's passwords / secrets manager (1Password or similar). Ask a team member if unsure.

When you run tests locally (`yarn test:unit` or `yarn e2e` and related commands), values are used from `.env.test.local`, `.env.test` and `.env`.

When you run the application locally. values are used from `.env` and `.env.local`.

If you need to add or change a variable on CI or a deployed environment, first see the 'Managing environment variables' section, below.

### Authentication

You need a `@hackney.gov.uk` Google account with the correct Google group membership to log in. Speak to Hackney IT if you don't have this.

Next, you need to tell your computer to run the app from a `hackney.gov.uk` domain. Let's use `localdev.hackney.gov.uk`. You will need to add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1       localdev.hackney.gov.uk
```

### Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localdev.hackney.gov.uk:5000/](http://localdev.hackney.gov.uk:5000/) with your browser to see the result.

### Tests

This application is using Jest, `react-testing-library`, for unit tests and can be run using the following command:

```
yarn test:unit
```

To keep the unit test output clear of known and expected console output weÂ can make use of [jest-clean-console-reporter](https://github.com/jevakallio/jest-clean-console-reporter). Rules can be added to `./reporter-rules.json` to suppress or group commands.

This application is using cypress, for end-to-end and integration tests and can be run using the following command:

```
yarn test:e2e (non-interative)

yarn e2e:interactive (interactive)
```

An individual Cypress spec can be run using the following command:

```
yarn e2e:server 'cypress run --spec cypress/integration/home_page.spec.js'
```

The full test suite including unit tests and system tests can be run using following command:

```
yarn tests
```

## Managing environment variables (including CI and deployed apps)

### Types of environment variables

1. Public variables which have the prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_` - these are exposed and used in the browser.
2. Server side only variables (without the above prefix). These are secrets and therefore real values should never be committed to the codebase - only references to secret storage should be used.

### Where values are set

This project sets environment variables in multiple places. Which values are used depends on where and how the code is being run.

Environment variable values are found in the following places (in addition to your local dotenv files):

- Hard coded exported variables in commands in the [Circle CI config file](./.circleci/config.yml). Typically used for non-secret vars.
- Exported variables in commands in the [Circle CI config file](./.circleci/config.yml) which reference [CircleCI project settings](https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/LBHackney-IT/repairs-hub-frontend/environment-variables?return-to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.circleci.com%2Fpipelines%2Fgithub%2FLBHackney-IT%2Frepairs-hub-frontend%3Ffilter%3Dall).
  These references are made using the `$` prefix. (Example `$OUT_OF_HOURS_LINK_STAGING`).
- AWS Parameter Store for a given environment, referenced from the [serverless config file](./serverless.yml)

### CI Builds

When running integration tests on Circle CI, the CircleCI project settings and from hardcoded values in the CircleCI config file.

### Deployed applications

When running the application in all deployed environments, server side environment variables are stored in AWS Parameter store (referenced in serverless.yml). Public variables are in the Circle CI config file - they are either hardcoded directly or they reference variables in CirceCI project settings.

## Deployments

Our serverless deployment service is configured in [serverless.yml](serverless.yml).

Continuous integration is managed with [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/LBHackney-IT/repairs-hub-frontend?filter=all).

See the wiki page for some [deployment tips](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/repairs-hub-frontend/wiki/Deployments-and-Environment-variables)

## Architecture

### Node API and how it relates to the Service API

This application includes a [Next JS API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) which is used for almost all API calls from the client.

In most cases, the API passes the request straight through to the backend service API using a "catch all" endpoint (`src/pages/api/[...path].js`).

However, at the time of writing there are some exceptions to this:

- Requesting a property can include contact information. Some users should not see that, and the response data anonymisation is done in the frontend API (`src/pages/api/properties/[id]/index.js`)
- Property search has been used to feature toggle integration with a new vs deprecated backend search endpoint, so there is logic to control this first in the Node API (`src/pages/api/properties/search.js`)
- Person alerts requires url-encoding of the property tenure reference (supplied to this endpoint as an id) so this is done before forwarding the request to the service API (`src/pages/api/properties/[id]/person-alerts.js`)
